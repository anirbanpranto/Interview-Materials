# My Tech Interview Preparation
This is my growing repository of materials related to CS Fundamentals like Algorithms, Data Structures, System Design, OS and Computer Networks. I will try my best to provide notes and clean code for all the materials. Apart from the purely theoretical things, there is a Leetcode section which applies some of the theory to practice.

Let's do great stuff!!!
