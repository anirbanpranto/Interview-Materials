# My Tech Interview Preparation
This is my growing repository of materials related to CS Fundamentals like Algorithms, Data Structures, System Design, OS and Computer Networks. I will try my best to provide notes and clean code for all the materials. Apart from the purely theoretical things, there is a Leetcode section which applies some of the theory to practice.

Let's do great stuff!!!

Problems to Review Later -
287 - Find The Duplicate (I couldn't solve it with constant space, Binary Search is required apparently)
447 - Find All Duplicate Numbers (Absolutely Bonkers Solution)
128 - Longest Consecutive Sequence (Cool problem but I'm not convinced that using set makes it O(n))
54 - Solved in hacky way, need to come up with cleaner and optimal solution
